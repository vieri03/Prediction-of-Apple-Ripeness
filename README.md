Prediction of Apple Ripeness Based on GLCM, CIE LAB, and Machine Learning

Apples as one of the agricultural commodities that are preferred because of their texture, nutrition, taste, and visual appeal. The level of maturity apple can be predicted from the texture and skin color of the apples. Texture analysis is performed using feature extraction of Gray Level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM), CIE Lab color space to analyze color, and combining both features in machine learning algorithms. Validation of the ripeness level of apples was carried out using iodine solution and calculating the starch conversion rate. The features extracted by GLCM at distances of 1, 2, 3 and angles of 0O, 45O, 90O, 135O are contrast, ASM, energy, homogeneity, and dissimilarity. The machine learning algorithm used is backpropagation neural network (BPNN), principal component analysis (PCA), and ten other algorithms. Machine learning is done with and without feature selection. The result is that by using the Z-value feature selection on Standard Error of difference means (SEd)
and PCA analysis then on the machine learning algorithm such as: Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVM, Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Net, AdaBoost,
Naive Bayes, and QDA obtained 100% accuracy. So that apple predictions based on ripeness level can be done using GLCM, Z-value SEd, and PCA analysis.
